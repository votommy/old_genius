# Old Genius
Genius.com recently transitioned to a new look that completely changed the tried-and-true layout. This extension will automatically change the lyrics pages to the old layout.

## How to Install:
In order to publish this onto the Chrome Web Store, one must pay a registration fee to become a Web Store Developer. I'm not willing to pay (lol), so you'll have to install it according to these instructions:

1. Download the ZIP file.<br>
![Step 1 screenshot](/images/README_Images/1.jpg "Step 1")
2. Extract "old_genius-main" folder to somewhere safe. I recommend in the same folder as Chrome's installation<br>
  (C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\).
3. Go to chrome://extensions/ in Chrome, and turn on Developer mode<br>

4. Click "Load unpacked", and select the "old_genius-main" folder
5. Done.
